  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Miles Randle.
      I am a Electrical Engineer.  I graduated from Prairie View A&M University in December 2018.  Currently, I am in Grad school working towards my MBA in Project Management/ Process Improvement.
 Honestly, after graduation, I didnt know what I wanted to do, so thats kind of how I ended up here.
       I was always was interersted in coding, but I didnt have a proper foundation, so I was kind of lost. 
        This program, Talent Path, is a great oppourtunity to learn more about the fundamentals, and hopefully I get to advance in my career. </p>
        <p> In my career, I would like to become a full stack engineer.  Ultimately, I would like to get into cybersecurity, but for now I'm just trying to get into the field.
